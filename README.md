# KickStarterPredictions
To predict whether a given project will be able to achieve its target amount in the given time frame.

We used various modeling techniques to improve the performance of our target variable altogether. In all, we tried six different models and out of all the models we could observe that the Lasso model had the highest performance. We used robust feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to maximize the modelâ€™s predictive accuracy. Apart from this we also used an external dataset and extracted relevant features to improve the performance.
